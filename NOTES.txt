Ways to choose sample (sgd.py)
full: all samples
stochastic: 1 random sample
batch: batched samples (optimal)

Update Weights:
Momentum and nesterov momentum: (mlp.py and momentum.py)
updating weights with additional momentum term.

variable and adaptable learning rates:
RMSprop (Root mean square)
rmsproptest.py (test initial cache for rms method)

Adam Optimizer (kind of RMSprop with momentum):
Adam (adaptive moment optimizer)
Bias Correction (biased towards zero at beginning)
